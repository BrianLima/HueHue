# HueHue
### Open source LED controler App for Windows, Arduinos and various RGB Devices


HueHue is a simple LED controler based on Arduino and open-source libraries aimmed for PC cases, tables, decoration and any place where you want to put Windows PC-controled LED kits, some will see some resemblance to stablished PC case manufacturers functionality in this.

#### What can it do:
- Real time controled fixed colors.
- Infinitely Alternate colors.
- Breathing effects.
- Rainbow color effects completely customizable by the user.
- Realtime music reactive color based on the default Windows audio device.
- "Snake" colors.
- Basic control of Razer Chroma devices using the Chroma SDK.

#### All featuring very low CPU usage, **Even on audio processing modes**, no ~~fake~~ "Cloud" computing, no data mining, no keyboard logging and etc.

Unfortunately, you do need to install each and every SDK related to your devices.

#### What it will do:
- CPU, GPU Temperature reactive colors.
- "Flu.x" like color effects to help reduce eye strain overnight.
- Better UI and user experience, with auto updating and etc.
- Sync effects with existing RGB hardware including Corsair, Logitech and ~~Razer~~ keyboards and mouses, or even Philips Hue Lights. 
- Auto change effects when a determined software starts running

#### What it will do maybe:
- Sync lights with games
- Scripting mode where you can program a effect manualy.

This is in early alpha, first public builds, releases and suport threads over Reddit shall be coming soon™.

Guides on getting the hardware should be arriving soon after the first release.
